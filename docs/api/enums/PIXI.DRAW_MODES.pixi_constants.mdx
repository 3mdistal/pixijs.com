## Summary
| Name                        | Default | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <code>LINE_LOOP</code>      | 2       | To draw a series of connected line segments. It also joins the first and last vertices to form a loop. |
| <code>LINE_STRIP</code>     | 3       | To draw a series of connected line segments.                                                           |
| <code>LINES</code>          | 1       | To draw a series of unconnected line segments (individual lines).                                      |
| <code>POINTS</code>         | 0       | To draw a series of points.                                                                            |
| <code>TRIANGLE_FAN</code>   | 6       | To draw a series of connected triangles sharing the first vertex in a fan-like fashion.                |
| <code>TRIANGLE_STRIP</code> | 5       | To draw a series of connected triangles in strip fashion.                                              |
| <code>TRIANGLES</code>      | 4       | To draw a series of separate triangles.                                                                |
