Various blend modes supported by PIXI.
IMPORTANT - The WebGL renderer only supports the NORMAL, ADD, MULTIPLY and SCREEN blend modes. Anything else will silently act like NORMAL.

| <code>SRC_ATOP</code>    | 23      | The new shape is only drawn where it overlaps the existing canvas content.                                                                         |
| <code>SRC_IN</code>      | 21      | The new shape is drawn only where both the new shape and the destination canvas overlap. Everything else is made transparent.                      |
